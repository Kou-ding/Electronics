# LM741 Import
Electronics 2 contains a library for the operational amplifier LM741. To import it you will need to:
- Edit the LM741.asy file so that it references the correct LM741.lib file path. (this is the place where you will keep the LM741 folder found in the repo)
- Move it to the LTspice directory residing inside your *Documents/* directory.  

Now open LTSpice for the 3 remaining steps:
- Click on Component(keyboard shortcut: P)
- Show: User Files: C:/users/username/Documents/LTspice
- Pick the LM741 model.

Done :)
